# PokemonRedRivalBattleML

## Main Idea
This project is an attempt to create an ai that can play the first rival battle from Pokemon Red optimally. The battle is very simple with one lvl. 5 starter vs. another lvl. 5 starter. Both pokemon have one attacking move and one stat-modifying move. 

In order to execute this project it is necessary to first build a simulation environment that matches the Pokemon Red mechanics. After the simulation environment is set up, an AI will complete several iterations of battling the rival AI until an optimal strategy is found using reinforcement learning.
